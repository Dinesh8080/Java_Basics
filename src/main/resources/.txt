Interview Question ha been asked in Backend JAVA 
REST CONSTRAINTS

REST works on 6 main rules:

Client – Server
Client (UI) and Server (API) are separate.

Stateless
Server does not store any client session.
Every request contains all required data.

Cacheable
Response can be stored in cache to improve speed.

Uniform Interface
Same API rules for all users.

Layered System
Request can pass through multiple layers like security, gateway, load balancer.

Code on Demand (Optional)
Server can send executable code (like JavaScript).

MVC (Model View Controller)

MVC is a design pattern used to structure applications.

Model
Handles business logic and database.

View
Handles UI (HTML, JSP, React).

Controller
Handles user requests and responses.

Flow:
User → Controller → Model → Controller → View

HashSet

HashSet stores only unique values.

Features:

No duplicate allowed

No order maintained

Uses HashMap internally

Uses hashCode() and equals()

Example:
If you add 10 two times, only one 10 will be stored.

ArrayList vs LinkedList

ArrayList:

Uses dynamic array

Fast for searching

Slow for insert and delete

Allows random access

LinkedList:

Uses nodes

Fast for insert and delete

Slow for searching

No random access

Use ArrayList when reading data is more.
Use LinkedList when adding or deleting data is more.

Method Handling in Java

Method Overloading
Same method name, different parameters.

Method Overriding
Child class changes parent class method.

Static Method
Belongs to class.

Final Method
Cannot be overridden.

Docker

Docker is a container tool.

It packages:
Application + Java + Libraries + OS

It makes application run same on all machines.

Used in:
Microservices
CI/CD
Cloud Deployment

REST API Performance

Why REST is fast:

Stateless design

Caching

Load balancing

Lightweight HTTP communication

How to improve performance:

Use pagination

Use caching (Redis)

Use async processing

Use proper database indexes
